database DBC

== Event Creation ==

UserA -> NodeA: Write Event E1
NodeA -> DBA: Store E1 with Vector Clock VC1

UserB -> NodeB: Write Event E2
NodeB -> DBB: Store E2 with Vector Clock VC2

UserC -> NodeC: Write Event E3
NodeC -> DBC: Store E3 with Vector Clock VC3

== Network Partition Occurs ==

== During Partition - Limited Communication ==

NodeA -> NodeB: Send Event E1 [Fails]
NodeB -> NodeA: Send Event E2 [Fails]
NodeC -> NodeA: Send Event E3 [Fails]
NodeC -> NodeB: Send Event E3 [Fails]

== Network Partition Ends ==

== Event Synchronization ==

NodeA -> NodeB: Send Event E1
NodeB -> NodeA: Send Event E2
NodeC -> NodeA: Send Event E3
NodeC -> NodeB: Send Event E3

NodeB -> DBB: Merge E1 using Vector Clocks
NodeA -> DBA: Merge E2 and E3 using Vector Clocks
NodeB -> DBB: Merge E3 using Vector Clocks
NodeC -> DBC: Merge E1 and E2 using Vector Clocks

== Updating Views ==

NodeA -> NodeA: Update View with E2 and E3
NodeB -> NodeB: Update View with E1 and E3
NodeC -> NodeC: Update View with E1 and E2

== Consistent State Achieved ==
